Brief Description:
This Project presents a Verilog-based implementation of three essential memory components: Single-Port RAM, Dual-Port RAM, and 8x8 Bit ROM. These modules are fundamental building blocks in digital systems and embedded applications, offering efficient memory storage and access mechanisms..

Working:
1. Single-Port RAM:  
   - This module provides a simple memory architecture with a single port for both read and write operations. The operations are managed based on a clock signal, an address input, and control signals for enabling and selecting between read or write modes. It demonstrates how to efficiently manage data in a sequential memory layout.

2. Dual-Port RAM:  
   - The dual-port RAM extends the functionality of single-port RAM by allowing simultaneous read and write operations through two separate ports. This makes it ideal for applications requiring concurrent access to memory, such as multi-threaded processing or data buffering in digital systems.

3. 8x8 Bit ROM:  
   - The Read-Only Memory (ROM) module represents a fixed memory array with 8 addresses, each holding an 8-bit data value. The ROM is preloaded with data during initialization and supports read-only access. This is commonly used for lookup tables, firmware storage, or constant data in hardware systems.

Conclusion:
The Verilog implementations provided in this repository demonstrate the design, simulation, and testing of memory components essential for various digital applications. With modular and well-documented code, this project serves as an excellent reference for understanding and implementing RAM and ROM architectures in Verilog.
